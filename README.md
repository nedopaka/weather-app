In this course, learn how to integrate the OpenAI API into a JavaScript-based web app. Join instructor Morten Rand-Hendriksen as he takes a React-based weather app, adds a heavy dose of AI, and creates an interactive experience that knows what location you want weather information from, explains the weather data in simple language, and even suggests what to wear. Through this project-based course, Morten teaches you about API integration, user-based authentication, storing user tokens in a ServiceWorker, task-based API configuration, and sending and receiving requests to the API.
